                <h3>the voice of freedom and love, forever resonating through our hearts.</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Bob Marley</b> (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer,
                    songwriter, and guitarist. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, he fused elements of reggae,
                    ska and rocksteady and was renowned for his distinctive vocal and songwriting style.[2][3] Marley
                    increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide and made him a global figure in popular
                    culture.[4][5] He became known as a Rastafarian icon, and he infused his music with a sense of
                    spirituality.[6] Marley is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and
                    identity and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms.[7][8] Marley
                    also supported the legalisation of cannabis and advocated for Pan-Africanism.[9]

                    Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his career in 1963, after forming the group Teenagers with
                    Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which became the Wailers. In 1965, they released their debut studio
                    album, The Wailing Wailers, which included the single "One Love", a reworking of "People Get Ready".
                    It was popular worldwide and established the group as a rising figure in reggae.[10] The Wailers
                    released 11 more studio albums, and after signing to Island Records, changed their name to Bob
                    Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, they began
                    engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with
                    Marley's conversion to Rastafari. Around this time, Marley relocated to London, and the group
                    embodied their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).[11]

                    Bob Marley and the Wailers began to gain international attention after signing to Island and touring
                    in support of the albums Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973). Following their disbandment a year
                    later, Marley carried on under the band's name.[12] The album Natty Dread (1974) received positive
                    reviews. In 1975, following the global popularity of Eric Clapton's version of Marley's "I Shot the
                    Sheriff",[13] Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, a live
                    version of "No Woman, No Cry", from the Live! album.[14] This was followed by his breakthrough album
                    in the United States, Rastaman Vibration (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul
                    Charts.[15] A few months later, Marley survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica,
                    which was believed to be politically motivated.[16] He permanently relocated to London, where he
                    recorded the album Exodus, which incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock and had
                    commercial and critical success. In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma; he
                    died in May 1981, shortly after baptism into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Fans around the world
                    expressed their grief, and he received a state funeral in Jamaica.

                    The greatest hits album Legend was released in 1984 and became the best-selling reggae album of all
                    time.[17] Marley also ranks as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated
                    sales of more than 75 million records worldwide.[18] He was posthumously honoured by Jamaica soon
                    after his death with a designated Order of Merit by his nation. In 1994, Marley was posthumously
                    inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone ranked him No. 11 on its list of the 100
                    Greatest Artists of All Time.[19] and No. 98 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All
                    Time.[20] His other achievements include a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a star on the
                    Hollywood Walk of Fame, and induction into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame.
